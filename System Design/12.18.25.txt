Page 179 page - In the chapter, we focus on designing a chat app like Facebook messenger, with an emphasis
on the following features:
• A one-on-one chat with low delivery latency
• Small group chat (max of 100 people)
• Online presence
• Multiple device support. The same account can be logged in to multiple accounts at the
same time.
• Push notifications
It is also important to agree on the design scale. We will design a system that supports 50
million DAU.
