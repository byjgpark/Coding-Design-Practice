page 55 - Each request consumes one token. When a request arrives, we check if there are enough
tokens in the bucket. Figure 4-5 explains how it works.
• If there are enough tokens, we take one token out for each request, and the request
goes through.
• If there are not enough tokens, the request is dropped.
