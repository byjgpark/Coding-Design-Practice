Page 58 - Fixed window counter algorithm
Fixed window counter algorithm works as follows:
• The algorithm divides the timeline into fix-sized time windows and assign a counter for
each window.
• Each request increments the counter by one.
• Once the counter reaches the pre-defined threshold, new requests are dropped until a new
time window starts.
