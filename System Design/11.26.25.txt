Page 60 - Sliding window log algorithm
As discussed previously, the fixed window counter algorithm has a major issue: it allows
more requests to go through at the edges of a window. The sliding window log algorithm
fixes the issue. It works as follows:
• The algorithm keeps track of request timestamps. Timestamp data is usually kept in
cache, such as sorted sets of Redis [8].
• When a new request comes in, remove all the outdated timestamps. Outdated timestamps
are defined as those older than the start of the current time window.
• Add timestamp of the new request to the log.
• If the log size is the same o
