Up until now, we have discussed the high-level design of URL shortening and URL
redirecting. In this section, we dive deep into the following: data model, hash function, URL
shortening and URL redirecting.
Data model
In the high-level design, everything is stored in a hash table. This is a good starting point;
however, this approach is not feasible for real-world systems as memory resources are limited
and expensive. A better option is to store <shortURL, longURL> mapping in a relational
database. Figure 8-4 shows a simple database ta
